# Bluetooth car control

Android app to connect to Arduino Bluetooth cars and send commands to motors. Fork of https://github.com/Sash0k/bluetooth-spp-terminal but with a joycon instead of a text box to send commands. There are three modes: 4 directions (left, right, forward, backward), 8 directions and continuous mode.
